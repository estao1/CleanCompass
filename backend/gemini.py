        f"3. Use the most appropriate modes STRICTLY based on SAVING time, carbon emissions, and cost based on the input data weight percentages.\n"
        f"   For example, if the carbon emissions preference input value is 1, the travel plan should be as eco-friendly as possible. 0 means it is not considered at all.\n"
        f"   The higher the Cost and/or Carbon percentages are the more it should be biking or walking as long as it's not unreasonable, such as walking/biking for several hours.\n"
        f"4. Only if the chosen mode is walking and the walking distance is more than 1.5 miles, the mode MUST be cycling no exceptions.\n"
        f"5. If 'fixed_order' is True, ALL locations MUST remain in the SAME given order as the input data.\n"
        f"6. If 'fixed_order' is False, you may reorder ONLY the middle locations. Starting and Ending Location must stay at the first and last elements in the returned list.\n"
        f"7. The output MUST be in the following strict format:\n\n"
            "[\n"
            "  { location: \"<Location Name>\", mode: \"<Mode of Transport>\" },\n"
            "  ...\n"
            "];\n\n"
        f"8. The output list's order of elements MUST be the order of the ideal travel route based on the input data.\n"
        f"9. No additional keys or data are allowed (e.g., coordinates, emissions, score, notes, cost). The 'locations' array must "
        f"contain all required locations in order for that route. The 'mode' key's value MUST indicate the mode of "
        f"transportation for each leg, where the transportation mode indicates from the current location to the next one in the list."
        f"Therefore the transportation mode for the last location in the list is irrelevant and MUST be an empty string.\n"
