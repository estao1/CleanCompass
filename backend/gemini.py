Description: A travel advisory web app that incorporates carbon emissions into travel itinerary creation. Users can create accounts that will be stored in the appâ€™s database. Query Page Inputs: 1. Locations the user wants to travel to. 2. A triangle graph selector for balancing carbon emissions, time/distance saved, and cost. 3. Travel dates. 4. AI-generated suggestions for tourist destinations and activities. 5. A text box for user-specific requests for the AI. 6. Advanced Options: A slider that determines how many times the AI (named Gemini) generates travel routes. Core Features and Calculation Process: 1. Gemini will generate multiple travel routes based on the parameters provided on the query page. 2. The travel route with the lowest carbon emission will be automatically selected. 3. The results page will display: Suggested travel routes using the Google Maps API, and a comparison showing what percentage less emissions this route has compared to the most time-efficient route. Prepare to assist with implementing the app's features, generating itinerary suggestions, calculating carbon emissions for routes, and integrating with Google Maps API. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with setup details."]
